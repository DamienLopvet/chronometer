This is a stopWatch with an option to modificate hours value;
Sometimes you want to know how long you have been working but using a stopWatch is triky because when you forget to stop it when you're done, it keep on running.
I looked fo a stopWatch that you can update. i did'nt find it.
i needed a stopWatch to evaluate my weekly work time with this nice option to update the hours value so i create it !
