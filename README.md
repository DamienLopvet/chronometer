<h2> Scenario </h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to know how long you have been working.<br>
<strong>Using a stopWatch </strong>can be tricky because when you forget to stop it when you're done, it keep on running !!<br>
I looked for a stopWatch that you can <strong>update</strong>. <br>
  And didn't find it.<br>
I needed a specific stopWatch to time my weekly work <br>
  with this nice option to update the hours or minutes values
  <strong>so i create it !</strong>
